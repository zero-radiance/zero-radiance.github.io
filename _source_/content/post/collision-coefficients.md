We have previously discussed the [radiative transfer equation](/post/analytic-media/) \[[1](#references), [2](#references)\] and its connection to [light scattered by small particles](/post/particle-volume/) \[[3](#references), [4](#references)\] in some detail. If the distribution of particles is known, once we obtain the efficiencies (and the phase function) of the individual particles, we can readily compute the volume collision coefficients (and the aggregate phase function) that determine the outcome of the radiative transfer process. However, so far, little has been said about the nature and the origin of these coefficients.

To give an example, consider the following problem of atmospheric radiative transfer. We wish to simulate a clear blue sky created by Earth's atmosphere. What should our coefficients be set to?

"The sky is blue, so the RGB color coefficient must be blue as well", you may say. While the answer is not completely wrong, unfortunately, it leaves the problem underspecified. For one, we have not one, but several collision coefficients - absorption, scattering and extinction. Secondly, we can represent them (as a set) in several different ways. We may decide to use an "artist-friendly" parametrization, such as the combination of the single-scattering albedo and the mean free path. Unfortunately, using a blue albedo and an (arbitrarily) large mean free path will not produce the expected result, particularly at sunset.

While we may spend more time and energy trying various different combinations of parameters to determine what works and what doesn't, there is another way. A more fun way. The scientific way.

The method can be briefly outlined as follows:

1. We describe radiation incident on the particle using Maxwell's wave theory of light.
2. We describe the shape, the size and the composition of the particle.
3. The incident wave interacts with the particle, producing a scattered wave.
4. Given the description of the incident and the scattered waves, we can compute the scattering and extinction efficiencies.

You may wonder why we have to use *wave optics*. One of the reasons is that *geometrical optics* fail to model light transport when the size of the geometric features is on the order of the wavelength of light. However, to obtain the correct solution, we must employ wave optics even when dealing with large particles. Below, I have reproduced the statement of Hendrik van de Hulst on the matter \[[4](#references) (ch. 12.1)\].

It is not expected that you understand the prior statement fully before reading the rest of the article. However, it should (hopefully) encourage you to learn a little bit about wave optics. A modest introduction is given below.

## Scalar Waves

The simplest type of wave is a [harmonic plane wave](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_20.html) \[Chandra?, [4](#references) (ch. 4), [5](#references) (vol. II, ch. 20), [6](#references) (ch. 1.4.2), [7](#references) (pp. 5-7)\]. Mathematically, the reason to consider harmonic plane waves is that they form the simplest set of solutions of the wave equation.

So, what is a *plane wave*, exactly? While plane waves are often introduced using the [Fresnel's formulation of Huygen's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens%E2%80%93Fresnel_principle) \[[4](#references) (ch. 3.1)\], I will attempt to give another, (hopefully) simpler explanation.

Consider an infinitesimal (punctual) isotropic source of "disturbance". It generates *spherical waves* that can be imagined as spheres expanding at constant velocity. We can imagine these spheres as sets of individual points. At a given point in time, all such points are at the same distance from the source. And if we fix a certain distance from the source, all points at this distance have been generated by the source at the same point in time. Loci of such points are said to form surfaces of constant *phase*, and these surfaces are called "wavefronts".

In the case of plane waves, surfaces of constant phase are planes rather than spheres. There are multiple ways to generate plane waves; one mathematical trick is to imagine an infinitesimal isotropic source at infinity. Then the curvature of the spherical wave approaches 0, and, locally, we may consider a small section of the spherical wavefront to be planar.

By *harmonic*, we mean that the amplitude of the wave is a [harmonic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_function) of space and time. For a plane scalar wave traveling along the \\(z\\)-axis, the *real amplitude* of the "disturbance" at the time \\(t\\) can be mathematically described [^1] as

[^1]: We use the "classic" sign convention of the authors cited.

$$ \tag{1} a(z,t) = a\_0 \cos(\delta - k z + \omega t), $$

where \\(a\_0\\) is the maximum amplitude, \\(\delta\\) is the phase shift, \\(k\\) is the complex wavenumber, and \\(\omega\\) is the angular frequency.

{{< figure src="/img/wave_diagram.png" caption="*Wave diagram. [Image source](https://tsunamiphysics.webnode.com/waves-review/).*">}}

Mathematically, it is convenient to describe a wave using the [complex amplitude](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_29.html) \[[5](#references) (vol. I, ch. 29)\]

$$ \tag{2} u(z,t) = a\_0 e^{i \theta} = a\_0 e^{i (\delta - k z + \omega t)} = a\_0 e^{i \phi} e^{i \omega t}. $$

If the ambient medium has a [complex index of refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index#Complex_refractive_index) \\(\eta - i \kappa\\), the [complex wavenumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavenumber#Complex) is

$$ \tag{3} k = k\_0 (\eta - i \kappa)
			 = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda\_0} (\eta - i \kappa)
			 = \frac{\omega}{c} (\eta - i \kappa), $$

where \\(k\_0\\) and \\(\lambda\_0\\) are the real wavenumber and wavelength in vacuum, respectively, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light.

Substitution transforms Equation 2 into a more explicit form

$$ \tag{4} u(z,t) = a\_0 e^{i (\delta - (\omega / c) (\eta - i \kappa) z + \omega t)}
			      = a\_0 e^{-\kappa (\omega z / c)} e^{i (\delta - \eta (\omega z / c) + \omega t)}. $$

We can take the argument to extract the *phase angle*

$$ \tag{5} \theta(z,t) = \mathrm{Arg} \big\lbrace u(z,t) \big\rbrace = \delta - \eta (\omega z / c) + \omega t = \phi + \omega t, $$

and taking the real part allows us to recover the real amplitude

$$ \tag{6} a(z,t) = \mathrm{Re} \big\lbrace u(z,t) \big\rbrace
			      = a\_0 e^{-\kappa (\omega z / c)} \cos{\theta(z,t)} . $$

When examining Equations 5 and 6, the first thing to notice is that \\(\omega z / c\\) and \\(\omega t\\) are both measured in radians. Looking closely, the role of the complex index of refraction (IOR) becomes apparent. The real part of the IOR, \\(\eta\\), reduces velocity of the wave from \\(c\\) to \\(c / \eta\\). The imaginary part of the IOR, \\(\kappa\\), corresponds to exponential [attenuation with distance](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_31.html) \[[5](#references) (vol. I, ch. 31)\].

## Transverse Waves

While scalar waves are characterized by the amplitude and the direction of propagation, [transverse](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Sound/tralon.html) waves have an orientation[^2] as well \[[9](#references)\].

[^2]: The "disturbance" is vector tangent to the surface of constant phase.

In the case of the electric field vector, it just means it has two scalar wave components rather than one:

$$ \tag{7} \bm{E}(z,t) =
	\begin{bmatrix}
    	E\_x(z,t) \cr
    	E\_y(z,t)
	\end{bmatrix} = A\_0
	\begin{bmatrix}
    	e^{-\kappa\_x (\omega z / c)} \cos(i (\delta\_x - \eta\_x (\omega z / c) + \omega t)) \cr
    	e^{-\kappa\_y (\omega z / c)} \cos(i (\delta\_y - \eta\_y (\omega z / c) + \omega t))
	\end{bmatrix}. $$

{{< figure src="/img/electric_field.png" caption="*Electric field vector \[[7](#references) (p. 6)\].*">}}

The frequency and the maximum amplitude are the same for both components, but this is where similarities end. Certain materials (with a [crystal lattice](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_30.html) \[[5](#references) (vol. II, ch. 30)\]) have a complex IOR that depends on the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident light. Additionally, the vector components may oscillate out of phase, which is mathematically modeled by independent phase shifts.

The vector nature of light waves (in mathematics) is referred to as the polarization of light (in physics).

## Polarization of Light

The idea behind [polarization of light](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/polarcon.html#c1) \[Chandra?, [4](#references) (ch. 5), [5](#references) (vol. I, ch. 33), [6](#references) (ch. 1.4), [7](#references), [8](#references) (p. 527-533), [9](#references)\] (not to be confused with [polarization of matter](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/dielec.html#c1) \[[4](#references) (ch. 4.5), [5](#references) (vol. II, ch. 32), [6](#references) (ch. 2.3), [9](#references)\]) is simple.
